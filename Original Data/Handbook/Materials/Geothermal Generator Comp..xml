					<Text>The geothermal Generator components are used to form a high tier passive power generation system capable of outputting  10 times the power fo a jet turbine. The geothermal generator must be placed in the cold caverns and fed Heat Conducting Pipes to start generating power. The Geothermal works by generating energy from heat differences, for every pipe placed below the cold cavern level the power generated per second will increase. Once the Heat Conducting Pipes reach the magma caverns they will start absorbing heat from the magma sea thereby generating exponentially more power than before. Since the Geothermal generates energy from heat differences feeding it freezon canisters should increase the Geothermalâ€™s energy production by a significant amount. </Text>

					<Text>The power storage block can hold a reserve of up to 200 energy. It will take energy from an attached generator and provide it to any attached machines or power transmitters. Multiple power storage blocks will share energy between themselves however this is not efficient for transmission of energy across more than a few blocks, laser power transmitters should be used instead for this purpose.</Text>

					<Text>The smelter will convert raw ore into bars which can be used in the manufacturing plant and elsewhere to craft new machines and items. The basic smelter is half the efficiency and half the speed of the regular smelter and cannot be upgraded with forced induction modules.</Text>

					<Text>Initially you will need to feed the smelter manually, this can be done by pressing the 'Interact' button (default 'E') to open the smelter control panel. You can then add ore by pressing the 'Feed ore' button, or by dragging a specific type of ore into the smelter. The control panel will indicate how much ore is required per bar while it is empty.</Text>

					<Text>Once the smelter has enough ore it will begin heating up, this requires power from an attached power storage block or power generator. When it reaches the correct temperature it will begin smelting ore into bars which can be collected by clicking on the output slot at the bottom of the control panel.</Text>

					<Text>The smelter should be automated as soon as possible with the addition of both input and output storage hoppers. The input hopper should be set to an I/O status of 'Remove only'. The input hopper must be big enough to contain the minimum ore requirement.</Text>

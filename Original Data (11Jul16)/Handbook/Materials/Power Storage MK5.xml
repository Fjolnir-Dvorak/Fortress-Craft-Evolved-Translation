					<Text>The power storage block MK5 can hold a reserve of up to 4.5 million energy. It will take energy from multiple attached generators and provide it to any attached machines or power transmitters. Multiple power storage blocks will share energy between themselves however this is not efficient for transmission of energy across more than a few blocks, laser power transmitters should be used instead for this purpose.</Text>
